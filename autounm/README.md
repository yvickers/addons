# autounm4
fixes some bugs with the original autounm and generally spruces everything up (and I added some fun target info stuff to make your botting more enjoyable!)


Please look at the READ THIS file in the Libraries before loading and make sure you setup the files appropriately, the addon WILL NOT LOAD if you do not do this step.

To set your server so that the price tracker for unm drop prices populates the correct prices, open mobDisplay.lua and change the server on line 40 to your server.


--Commands

//unm start obj1 - this is all you should usually need

//unm start obj2 - if doing the 2nd unm in a zone with more than one

//unm stop - self explanatory

//unm stuck - release yourself if you manage to get packet locked

//unm verbose - turns debug logging on or off, on by default
